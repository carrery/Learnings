## Head First Design Patterns
Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson

This book is for computer professionals specially developers who want to improve their coding skills. It is a good book and I like the way the author put a lot of images for the readers to visualize and understand the topic. Well I’m not a fan of reading book since it makes me sleepy and bored however for a person like me who doesn’t usually read books I can say that those pictures help to make the book and topic more interesting.

Here are the summary and learnings I have gained for each pattern.

### Strategy Pattern

Strategy defines a family of algorithms encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable. In the book they used a duck pond simulation game called “SimUDuck” as an example. The game can show a large variety of duck species swimming and making quacking sounds. The initial design is a Duck superclass which all other duck types inherit.
